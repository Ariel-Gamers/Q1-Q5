This project is an Implementatio of Dijkstra Algorithem for enemies (to locate the player quickly)
as well as Implemet Mining using a keyboard Key.

* All scripts have detailed info inside the C# Scripts

## Question 1 - Dijkstra Algorithem Implementation for enemies
# Scripts used:
* interface Weighted Graph:
//blob/main/Assets/Scripts/0-bfs/WGraph.cs
* Algorithms class:
//blob/main/Assets/Scripts/0-bfs/Dijkstra.cs
* Tiles Weighted Graph:
//blob/main/Assets/Scripts/0-bfs/TilemapGraph.cs
* uses Dijkstra:
//blob/main/Assets/Scripts/0-bfs/TileMapDijkstra.cs
* Target Mover:
//blob/main/Assets/Scripts/TargetMover_Dijkstra.cs

## Question 5 - Implemet Mining using a keyboard Key
# Scripts used:
* keyboardmover_q5 - add objects for overriding.
//blob/main/Assets/Scripts/Keyboardmover_q5.cs
* definition mountain's tiles - implements keyboardmover_q5
//blob/main/Assets/Scripts/Keyboardmoverbytiles_q5.cs
